### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I'm **Zartash Zulfiqar**. I'm a **Senior Software Engineer** in DatumSquare IT Services having more than 7 years of experience in **PHP (Laravel, Codeigniter, Custom), JavaScript (Vue.js, React, jQuery, jQuery UI, Bootstrap Calendar, AJAX, JSON), HTML, CSS (Bootstrap 3, Bootstrap 4, Bootstrap 5, Tailwind CSS, Custom).**

I love to write code in my free times also. I also watch tv series & movies in my free time. I love to read books related to history, funny, spy & suspense. 

- ðŸ”­ I'm currently working on a scrapper which will scrap jobs from indeed.com. I have also been working on an admin panel using react.
- ðŸŒ± I always learned something new in my free times. And currently I'm learning about Flutter, Linux & Genesys Cloud.
- ðŸ‘¯ I'm looking to collaborate on a project that can provide ease to developers. I want to automate common tasks of programming. So that we don't need to repeat ourselves for the same tasks each time.
- ðŸ’¬ If you need any help related to programming or logic building, or need any suggestion related to your career development you can contact me.
- ðŸ“« Email me at: [zartashzulfiqar@gmail.com](zartashzulfiqar@gmail.com).
- âš¡ The interesting but maybe stupid fact is I always learn a lot of things at the same time & switches a lot between different topics instead of focusing on one thing. In my opinion it's stupid, maybe you have different opinion.
-  âš¡ One more interesting fact is even after 7 years of career I'm trying to push my limits so that I can see myself where can I reach? I have stopped myself first, but now I have sacrificed my comfort zone to see my limits where it can lead me?
